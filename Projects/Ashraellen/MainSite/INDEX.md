# MainSite — Ashraellen website memory

Status: active working memory hub  
Created: 2026-06-22  
Repository: `Ashraellen/apm`  
Root path: `Projects/Ashraellen/MainSite/`

## Purpose

This directory is the central memory hub for all work related to the main Ashraellen website: structure, content, multilingual versions, grant positioning, technical decisions, SEO/metadata, assets, landing pages, and incoming summaries from older chats.

The goal is not to replace the live website repository. This directory is a working archive and coordination layer: first gather information from scattered chats, then sort it, then create one clean master file for future site work.

## Working principle

1. Each old chat that contains site-related work should produce a compact handoff file.
2. Those files should be placed in `Inbox_From_Chats/`.
3. After review, stable decisions move into `Decisions/` and/or `MASTER_MainSite.md`.
4. Current tasks and unresolved questions go into `Tasks/`.
5. Technical implementation details go into `Technical/`.
6. Language and translation decisions go into `Languages/`.
7. Content architecture and public positioning go into `Content/` and `Grant_Positioning/`.
8. Active implementation decisions and transitional architecture notes may be placed in `Working_Notes/` before they are merged into the master memory.

## Current source of truth

Until a full audit is complete, the strongest current sources are:

- `MASTER_MainSite.md` — living master file.
- `Decisions/Public_Thoughts_Multilingual_Rollout_Decisions_2026-06-23.md` — **canonical source of truth** for the completed multilingual support-thought layer 0001–0012. It defines architecture, terminology, rotation rules, text-protection rules, assets, old-formula preservation, multilingual rollout and next-chat instructions.
- `Decisions/2026-06-22_current_chat_site_decisions.md` — first consolidated memory from the current chat and known prior site decisions.
- `Prompts/Request_Other_Chats_Site_Memory.md` — reusable prompt for extracting site memory from older chats.
- `Working_Notes/RU_Public_Thoughts_Rotating_Architecture_2026-06-23.md` — Russian implementation note for the rotating public support-thoughts system. It supports the canonical decision file but does not override it.
- `Working_Notes/RU_Public_Thoughts_Migration_2026-06-22.md` — **superseded historical note only**. Do not use it as an active architecture source.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_RU_Public_Thoughts_Build_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the correct 0001–0006 support-thought pages and rebuilding `/ru/public/thoughts/index.html`.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_RU_Public_Thoughts_Assets_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for moving the new support-thought layer image references to `assets/thoughts/` while preserving the old formula layer.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_RU_Public_Thoughts_0007_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating support-thoughts 0007–0012 and updating `/ru/public/` as the current live showcase.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_RU_Public_Thoughts_0013_0018_2026-06-24.md` — implementation log for creating support-thoughts 0013–0018, updating `/ru/public/` as the current live showcase, rotating `0007–0012` into `/ru/public/thoughts/`, and archiving `0001–0006` as `index-0001.html`.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_EN_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the English support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_PL_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the Polish support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_UK_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the Ukrainian support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_BE_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the Belarusian support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_PT_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the Portuguese support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_ES_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the Spanish support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_FR_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the French support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.
- `Session_Logs/MS_SL_DE_Public_Thoughts_0001_0012_2026-06-23.md` — implementation log for creating the German support-thought architecture and transcreating 0001–0012.

## Public Thoughts warning for new chats

For `Public Thoughts` / `Опорные мысли`, do not revive older intermediate schemes.

Current canonical pattern:

```text
/[lang]/public/
→ current live six

/[lang]/public/thoughts/
→ newest completed support-thought arc

/[lang]/public/thoughts/index-000N.html
/[lang]/public/thoughts/index-000(N-1).html
...
/[lang]/public/thoughts/index-0001.html
→ older completed arcs in descending historical order; the larger the arc number, the newer the arc

/[lang]/public/thoughts/arcs/0001-cheerfulness.html
/[lang]/public/thoughts/arcs/0002-still-the-same.html
→ individual support-thought pages

/[lang]/public/posts/formula/
→ short formulas, separate branch

/[lang]/public/formulas/
→ old historical formula layer, preserve unless explicitly decided otherwise
```

Do not use as active architecture:

```text
/[lang]/public/thoughts/01-cheerfulness/
/[lang]/public/thoughts/arcs/arc-0001.html
/[lang]/public/formulas/arcs/
```

## Sorting rule

Do not copy raw notes directly into the master file. First place incoming material in `Inbox_From_Chats/`, then extract confirmed decisions, open questions, useful text fragments, technical paths, language/version notes, and outdated or rejected ideas.

This keeps the website memory clean and navigable.
